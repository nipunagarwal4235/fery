    title: "FIVE WAYS TO EMPOWER WOMEN IN WORKPLACE",
    blog: (
      <p>
        Women can have greater influence over their life when they are empowered
        in the job. This entails allowing them the ability to create their own
        programmes, develop new skills, and attain independence. When women's
        strengths are acknowledged and utilised in the workplace, women feel
        empowered.
        <br />
        Here are the few ways to promote women empowerment at work-
        <br />
        1-More Female Employment Opportunities Women don't have access to equal
        career possibilities despite making substantial contributions to social
        and economical progress. Organizations for equal rights can contribute
        greatly to the advancement of just hiring practices and public policies
        that support progress and growth. <br />
        2- Support flexible scheduling Flexibility, whether it be part-time or
        remote employment, aids individuals in juggling their professional and
        personal obligations. Of course, it isn't only for women; in fact, 70%
        of women prefer more flexible work arrangements, and having a mobile
        workforce has several advantages for businesses. However, there's no
        denying that allowing for more flexibility might encourage workers to
        continue working even when they have small children or care obligations.{" "}
        <br />
        3-Stop sexual harassment. Giving opportunity is the definition of
        empowerment, but before doing so, be sure to provide a secure atmosphere
        for women. The protection of women in your business is the most crucial
        issue. Provide them with a solid sexual harassment policy that
        guarantees prompt correction of any wrongdoing and stringent
        disciplinary measures.
        <br />
        4-Support the leadership of women Leading is not only a man's thing.
        Encourage women in your workplace to take greater chances and seize
        opportunities to break this stereotype. Give them a stage on which to
        display their abilities and accomplish the remarkable. <br />
        5- Encourages the adoption of a fair maternity leave policy: Establish a
        reasonable maternity policy at work to help new mothers both financially
        and emotionally. Give them the tools they need by implementing a liberal
        and equitable maternity leave policy so that after they have children,
        women may re-join the workforce with the same enthusiasm as before.

    title: "PROBLEM FACED BY SOLO WOMEN WHILE TRAVELLING ",
    blog: (
      <>
        <p>
          When it comes to travel, women have taken over more and more, whether
          they are travelling in families, groups, or alone. More women are
          stepping outside of their comfort zones in search of a break from the
          routine of everyday life. All in stark contrast to a few decades ago.
          Naturally, whether travelling alone or with a family, women have
          different difficulties or circumstances that are more favourable in
          various regions of the world. Here’s what to expect: 1- Security and
          safety This problem is at the top of the list of difficulties
          encountered by women travellers. Not that guys don't experience safety
          concerns also, but unfortunately, women are more exposed. No matter
          how prepared, watchful, or skilled in self-defense women are, there is
          always a chance of facing danger. It will be helpful to do research on
          the destination and accommodation, make friends with a trustworthy
          local, and be aware of any local safety issues. 2-Lack of basic
          amenities Women travellers are forced to make sacrifices in several
          areas, including accommodations, sanitary pads, and clean public
          restrooms. Women who travel alone frequently face hostility from the
          so-called "culture," suspicion, and even slut shaming. The situation
          would have been much simpler if there had been more female attendants
          and functional cameras set in more places for every female lodging,
          along with clean amenities. 3- unnecessary attentiveness You'll get
          noticed whether you're a solo woman or part of a group of ladies. And
          on sometimes, it may get frustrating. Unnecessary attention might
          result in unpleasant situations or interactions, both of which can
          ruin any vacation. 4-Cultural barriers Gender segregation is strictly
          prohibited in several regions of the world, such as the Middle East.
          In other cultures, women are also obliged to dress in a particular way
          and adhere to specific regulations. There are regions, for instance,
          where it is mandatory for all women to cover particular body parts or
          wear a hijab. This can be difficult since it occasionally discourages
          women from going to these areas.

    title: "ROLE OF WOMEN ENTERPREURSHIP IN INDIA’S ECONOMIC GROWTH 2022",
    blog: (
      <>
        <p>
          In several sectors, female company owners are thriving and even
          exceeding their male colleagues. Women are increasingly proving their
          strength in business and industry in addition to their achievement in
          the fields of law, research, medicine, aeronautics, space exploration,
          and even the police and military. They have shown that, when given the
          correct scope, they are equally as capable, hardworking, and
          intelligent as men. Women who own their own businesses typically have
          strong levels of motivation and self-direction, as well as a high
          internal centre of control and accomplishment. According to
          researchers, women who run their own businesses have some unique
          traits that encourage their creativity and help them come up with
          novel concepts and methods. By putting more emphasis on childcare,
          education, and the health of both the family and the individual,
          encouraging women to start businesses may result in societal effects
          that are unequal. Additionally, women in roles of power can encourage
          more women to enter the workforce, which will promote gender
          diversity. Over the past several years, women-owned firms and
          enterprises have performed well financially in a variety of areas. The
          use and investment of cash acquired are more important than just
          managing money. Such important choices have long-term, significant
          effects on enterprises. Having a budget allows you to manage your
          financial flow better. Even during times of extraordinary occurrences,
          financial success may be maintained by allocating the available money
          in a way that supports necessary or desired expansion. Studies have
          shown that women are excellent entrepreneurs because they can maintain
          a healthy work-life balance. These elements may differ from location
          to location and business to business, but women's entrepreneurship is
          essential to the expansion of any economy, no matter how big or small.

    title: "Travelling Alone at night not safe for women...",
    blog: (
      <>
        <p>
          Imagine a person working hard at the office and working even after
          office hours. Well, most of you must have imagined it to be a man. It
          is because of the way we have seen these things or heard stories.
          There are also multiple reasons for us not to see an image of a woman
          working late. One of the reasons which is not talked about much is
          because there is always a question that comes up with her working late
          is, “Travelling late at night is not safe for women and how will she
          travel alone? Traveling alone for a woman is a big task for numerous
          reasons. 1. What will people say? The driver of the cab could abduct
          you. 2. People everywhere, in public transport or on roads do make it
          a point to pass comments on girls' bodies especially when they are
          alone. Women deal with it every day and even more while traveling
          solo. 3. The moment people know a girl is alone, their suspicious,
          criminal minds are elevated. Bottom line, a woman traveling alone is
          still not considered a normal and casual thing. According to society,
          a woman shouldn't travel alone especially at night because it’s not
          safe. But nobody talks about making travel easy for women so that they
          can travel alone at night after a party, after work, trips, and for
          any reason, they want to go out. It is not just the government’s
          responsibility to make laws or provide security and facility for a
          woman to travel. Because even after that it is also the mentality of
          the society that needs to change. Traveling or commuting from one
          place to another is such a basic and normal thing to do and hence,
          women traveling alone or late should be normalized
